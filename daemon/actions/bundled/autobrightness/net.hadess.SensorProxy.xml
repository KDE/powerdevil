      After checking the availability of the sensor type you want to monitor,
      call the net.hadess.SensorProxy.ClaimAccelerometer() or the
      net.hadess.SensorProxy.ClaimLight() method to start updating the properties
      from the hardware readings.

      The object path will be "/net/hadess/SensorProxy".

       accelerometer appears.

       Applications should call net.hadess.SensorProxy.ReleaseAccelerometer() when
       readings are not required anymore. For example, an application that monitors
       the orientation of the main screen should stop monitoring for updates when that
       screen has been turned off.

       This prevents the sensor proxy from polling the device, thus increasing wake-ups
       and reducing battery life.
