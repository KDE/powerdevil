/**
 * @brief The base class for Power Management Actions
 *
 * The Action class is the very base class for writing a new Power Management action.
 * Developers wishing to implement their own action are supposed to subclass Action.
 *
 * @par Creating a brand new Action
 *
 * If you are already familiar with KDE's plugin system, you have to know that actions are
 * nothing but a KCoreAddons plugin which will be loaded on demand. Each action has an ID associated to it
 * which uniquely identifies it in the loading phase.
 *
 * In addition to standard parameters, the .json file representing your action should contain the following
 * entry:
 *
 * @code
 * X-KDE-PowerDevil-Action-ID: YourActionID
 * @endcode
 *
 * The most important functions you need to reimplement are loadAction and triggerImpl. The first is called
 * whenever an action is loaded, carrying the action's configuration. The other is called whenever
 * the action is triggered. You usually want to process the action here as triggerImpl is guaranteed
 * to be called just when policies are satisfied.
 *
 * @par Runtime requirements
 *
 * Some actions might be available only when the system satisfies certain hardware or software runtime requirements.
 * In this case, powerdevil provides a way for the action to advertise to the outside whether it is supported or
 * not. This can be done by reimplementing @c isSupported and adding to the .json file the field
 *
 * @code
 * X-KDE-PowerDevil-Action-HasRuntimeRequirement: true
 * @endcode
 *
 * Done that, powerdevil will take care of exposing your action only if support for it is advertised. In addition,
 * the UI will expose the configuration of your action only if its support is advertised. Of course, this means the
 * action will be temporarily loaded by the config UI to verify its support. If your action is performing some tasks in
 * the constructor besides setting policies, revise your design since you probably don't need or want to do that.
 *
 * @par Handling policies from within the action
 *
 * As you might know, the KDE Power Management system features a very efficient policy handler, which
 * prevents Power Management actions when certain condition occurs. The integration with Actions is very easy:
 * in your Action's constructor, you want to call setRequiredPolicies, stating which policies have to be
 * satisfied to perform the action. For example, if your action should not be performed whenever the session
 * cannot be interrupted, you would pass @c InterruptSession.
 *
 * Done that, your action is already obeying to the policy. trigger, in fact, calls triggerImpl just when
 * the policies are allowing your action to be performed.
 *
 * @since 4.6
